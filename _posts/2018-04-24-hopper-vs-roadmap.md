title: Hopper vs Roadmap

# {{ page.title }}

Ryan Singer has mentioned that they use "[A hopper, not a roadmap](https://twitter.com/rjs/status/961758256598274050)" as a way of managing upcoming work.

Here's his definition:

> A collection of ideas about what to do in the future without any order or sequence and without any commitment to doing any of them.

So in contrast, a roadmap (or backlog) is usually:

> A list of defined work that is committed to and completed in sequence.

## Problems with Roadmaps

* They're **not flexible** – the right thing when you planned the work might not be the right thing when you come to tackle the work.
* They're **often order-dependent**, which means you _can't_ drop items if they get stuck.
* There's a **feeling of _debt_** – there's always a constant stream of work to do before you can even think about working on some other task that recently became important.

## How to move to a Hopper

I think using a Hopper in the way that Basecamp do requires [lots of other work practices](https://www.feltpresence.com/how-we-work) to be in place so that the _system_ works together.

In smaller teams where the team is both defining concepts and implementing the work, or where the Hopper idea is failing because you're lacking some other parts of the system, I think a hybrid approach may help move in the right direction.

I visualise the Hopper as a 3 × 2 × 1 grid:

* Items at the top are looser pitches and can be changed freely.
* Items in the middle are having background work done on them to help define the concept.
* The item at the bottom is a clearly defined concept ready to be worked on.

Items closer to the mouth have a higher cost of change, as more homework has been done on these. The homework is still useful even if the item is switched out, but the team will need to re-familiarise with the problem if it gets chosen in a later cycle.
