I *know* you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, but which would you take more seriously?

<div class="grids cf">

	<figure class="grid-1">
		<figcaption><a href="http://php.net" title="PHP">PHP</a></figcaption>
		<a href="http://php.net" title="PHP"><img src="/images/posts/php-net.png" alt="Screenshot of php.net" /></a>
	</figure>

	<figure class="grid-1">
		<figcaption><a href="http://ruby-lang.org" title="Ruby">Ruby</a></figcaption>

The PHP site is just a giant wall of text. At least Ruby is more inviting from the outset.

## Okay, Ruby is best known because of Railsâ€¦

Maybe I shouldn't beat up on PHP. It's old, and people know Ruby because of Ruby on Rails. Let's compare that to Zend, the [most popular PHP framework of 2011](http://www.php-developer.org/most-used-php-framework-the-popular-top-7-list-in-year-2011).

<div class="grids cf">

	<figure class="grid-1">
		<figcaption><a href="http://framework.zend.com/" title="Zend Framework">Zend</a></figcaption>
		<a href="http://framework.zend.com/" title="Zend Framework"><img src="/images/posts/zend.png" alt="Screenshot of framework.zend.com" /></a>
	</figure>

	<figure class="grid-1">
		<figcaption><a href="http://rubyonrails.org" title="Ruby on Rails">Ruby on Rails</a></figcaption>

It's a bit better, but still looks like "Web 2.0" shine with no substance.

PHP could do worse than improving it's website while it's getting so much bad press from all the new languages.
