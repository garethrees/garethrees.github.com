If you [release often](http://www.boxuk.com/blog/towards-faster-releases), you may find you want to push a feature branch on to a server before you merge it in to your master branch.

Capistrano can be set up to deploy a branch and make it the current live branch pretty easily.

See my post on the [Box UK blog](http://www.boxuk.com/blog/deploy-any-branch-with-capistrano) for more.
