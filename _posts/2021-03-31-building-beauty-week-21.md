## Studio

This week, encouraged by the class tutors, I tried a new design from the point of view of an empty room, focused around the window as the main centre.

I made a couple of sketches to get a feel for the direction and then modelled away.

While this created a slightly better window seat, the rest of the room just felt too cramped.

They’ve also been encouraging me to explore the idea of a bay window. I’m totally not convinced about this in the context of British terraced houses, but since it’s just some cardboard it was easy enough to try.

It wasn’t as bad as I thought it might be, but I still wouldn’t actually do it.

## Nature of Order

I finally finished Book 3!

Book 3 was fun, in that it was _full_ of examples of the work Alexander has done and how he approached the projects using the ideas and processes explained in Book 1 and 2.

It was _loooong_ though. 700+ pages.

## Beautiful Software

It’s difficult to write anything coherent about this part of the course still, because we’re still grappling with the ideas and how much – if at all – they apply to software. To me, the ideas of Book 2 – around the process of making – have a fairly clear mapping. What we’re not sure of at all is whether the 15 Fundamental Properties apply.

Here’s an idea of some of the conversations we’ve been having.
