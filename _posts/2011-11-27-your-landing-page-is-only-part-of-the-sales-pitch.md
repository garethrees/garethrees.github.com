# {{ page.title }}

A few months ago [I blogged](http://garethrees.co.uk/2011/09/01/thank-you-for-registering) about making emails from apps more personal to nurture a better relationship with customers.

I signed up to [Verify](http://verifyapp.com) to have a go at some rough A/B testing on a design. I hadn't realised the free plan only let you see the first 5 responses before you had to pay, so I didn't spend much time with it.

I received this email from the app the following day.

## Here's How I Reacted

Firstly, I was a little *confused*.

Who is Louis Corso? He's addressed me by first name and says he's following up from yesterday. Have I forgotten a call I've made? Oh, that's nice, he asked how I am.

**Ahhhhh**, it was from the A/B test I did. Yeah, I've viewed my responses thanks.


## A Real Person?

I'm sure the email was automatically generated, but it had me going while I scanned through. I was convinced it was real. The language was very informal and it sounded like a *real person*.

The first thing to notice is that there's no branding. If there was I'd have known they were trying to SELL, SELL, SELL. It's just a regular plain text email like I'd receive from a friend.

The fact I actually read the whole thing is **so important**. This one actually took me through it all, which could have converted me to a paying customer.

Your landing page is only *part* of the sales pitch. Every step needs to be optimised to convert as many people as possible. Don't underestimate the impact that direct email can have.
