To be virtuous, then, is to live as we were designed to live; it is to live, as Zeno put it, in **accordance with nature**.

Be “**the user, but not the slave**, of the gifts of Fortune.”

And a good technique to start with, I think, is **negative visualization**.

After mastering negative visualization, a novice Stoic should move on to become proficient in applying the **trichotomy of control**, described in chapter 5.

…as part of becoming proficient in applying the trichotomy of control, to practice **internalizing your goals**.

…in conjunction with applying the trichotomy of control, to become a psychological **fatalist about the past and the present**—**but not about the future**.

…respond to this insult in a Stoically acceptable manner, with self-deprecating humor:

Instead of letting myself be angered by events, I persuade myself to laugh at them. Indeed, I try to think of ways the imaginary absurdist playwright could have made things still more absurd.

Yoga has been a wonderful source of voluntary discomfort.

Another source of discomfort—and admittedly, of entertainment and delight as well—is rowing.

**Whenever you undertake an activity in which public failure is a possibility, you are likely to experience butterflies in your stomach.**

When doing things to cause myself physical and mental discomfort, **I view myself—or at any rate, a part of me—as an opponent in a kind of game**. This opponent—my “other self,” as it were—is on evolutionary autopilot: He wants nothing more than to be comfortable and to take advantage of whatever opportunities for pleasure present themselves. My other self lacks self-discipline; left to his own devices, he will always take the path of least resistance through life and as a result will be little more than a simple-minded pleasure seeker. He is also a coward. My other self is not my friend; to the contrary, he is best regarded, in the words of Epictetus, “as an enemy lying in wait.”

To win points in the contest with my other self, I must establish my dominance over him.

The Stoics, as we have seen, recommend simplifying one’s lifestyle.

My time is coming, I told myself, and I must do what I can to prepare for it.

Then it dawned on me what utter foolishness it would be to do anything other than embrace them. And so I have.
