# How do you deal with design disagreements?

In work we’re designing a landing page that acts as a springboard to different areas of advice our company provides. We came to a point where we disagreed on the best way to lay out the links to specific advice within each section.

How do you resolve a disagreement between two design decisions that both have valid arguments for and against them?

When disagreeing on programming, the answer can be relatively easy. The “winner” [supports any bugfixes and customer service issues](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1046-ask-37signals-how-do-you-handle-disagreements) that arise due to the decision.

But how do you decide between two different designs? Answering my own question, [A/B testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) is probably the best way, as you can usually derive a clear winner from the figures it returns.
