## Chapter 1: The Problem

The first step to knowledge is the confession of ignorance.

The question “How much time and money?” lies at the very foundation of the general systems movement.

We do not need exact measures. Instead, we merely want to estimate how the amount of computation increases as the size of the problem increases.

_Unless some simplifications can be made_, the amount of computation involved increases at least as fast as the square of the number of equations.

### Simplification

A general systems thinker's task is to understand the simplifying assumptions of a science.

> …_objects of interest_ and _well defined conditions_ that delimit its _domain of application_ and _magnify the power of prediction_.

A separation of a system into noninteracting subsystems is an extremely important technique known to all developed sciences.

An organism must have a comparatively gross structure in order to enjoy the benefit of fairly accurate laws.

![Types of systems with respect to methods of thinking](/images/posts/an-introduction-to-general-systems-thinking/types-of-systems.jpg)

* Randomnes ~ Diversity
* Complexity ~ Population
* High randomness + high complexity: Use aggregates
* Low randomness + low complexity: Use mechanics
* Medium randomness + Medium complexity: Use Systems Thinking
