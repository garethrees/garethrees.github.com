You need to be good at something before you can expect a good job.

Mastery by itself is not enough to guarantee happiness:

- **Autonomy**: the feeling that you have control over your day, and that your actions are important
- **Competence**: the feeling that you are good at what you do
- **Relatedness**: the feeling of connection to other people

The traits that define great work are bought with career capital.

To earn career capital, abandon the passion mindset ("what can the world offer me?") and instead adopt the craftsman mindset ("what can I offer the world?").

It's dangerous to pursue more control in your working life before you have career capital to offer in exchange.

## 1: Decide what capital market you're in

Winner-take-all or auction. (Diverse collection of skills, or one killer skill.)

* **Winner takes all**: get good at the skill above all else
* **Auction**: There are many different types of career capital, and each person might generate their own unique collection.

## 2: Identify the specific type of capital to pursue

* Winner takes all: there's only one type of capital
* Auction: Seek opportunities to build capital that are already open to you. Open gates get you farther faster.

Think about skill acquisition like a freight train: Getting it started requires a huge application of effort, but changing its track once it's moving is easy. In other words, it's hard to start from scratch in a new field.

## 3: Clear goals

For a script writer, the definition of "good" was clear: his scripts being taken seriously.

## 4: Deliberate practice

Consistently push slightly beyond comfort zone and get feedback regularly

## 5: Look years into the future for the payoff.

Ignore other pursuits that pop up along the way to distract you.

The things that make a great job great… are rare and valuable. If you want them in your working life, you need something rare and valuable to offer in return.

Mastery by itself is not enough to guarantee happiness: The many examples of well-respected but miserable workaholics support this claim.

The strongest predictor of someone seeing their work as a calling is the number of years spent on the job. The more experience they have, the more likely they are to love their work.

Motivation requires that you fulfil three basic psychological needs:

- **Autonomy**: the feeling that you have control over your day, and that your actions are important
- **Competence**: the feeling that you are good at what you do
- **Relatedness**: the feeling of connection to other people

When you focus only on what your work offers you, it makes you hyperaware of what you don't like about it.

If you want to love what you do, abandon the passion mindset ("what can the world offer me?") and instead adopt the craftsman mindset ("what can I offer the world?").

> When she left her advertising career to start a yoga studio, not only did she discard the career capital acquired over many years in the marketing industry, but she transitioned into an unrelated field where she had almost no capital.


> Instead of fleeing the constraints of his current job, he began acquiring the career capital he'd need to buy himself out of them. As his ability grew, so did his options. He invested his capital to gain more autonomy, this time by starting his own fifteen-person shop: He started his own company with enough career capital to immediately thrive, and had a waiting list of clients.

The traits that define great work are bought with career capital.

### Three Disqualifiers for Applying the Craftsman Mindset:

1. The job presents few opportunities to distinguish yourself by developing relevant skills that are rare and valuable.
2. The job focuses on something you think is useless or perhaps even actively bad for the world.
3. The job forces you to work with people you really dislike.

Most individuals who start as active professionals change their behaviour and increase their performance for a limited time until they reach an acceptable level. Beyond this point, however, further improvements appear to be unpredictable.

This learning is not done in isolation: You need to be constantly soliciting feedback from colleagues and professionals.

Do projects where you'll be forced to show your work to others.

The traits that Anders Ericsson defined as crucial for deliberate practice.:
He stretched his abilities by taking on projects that were beyond his current comfort zone… He then obsessively sought feedback

He then obsessively sought feedback, on everything-even if, looking back now, he's humiliated at the quality of scripts he was sending out.
This is textbook deliberate practice: And it worked.

When running his start-up, this feedback took the form of how much money came through the door. If he ran the company poorly, there would be no escaping this fact: His critique would arrive in the form of bankruptcy.

A spreadsheet, which he uses to track how he spends every hour of every day. "At the beginning of each week I figure out how much time I want to spend on different activities. I then track it so I can see how close I came to my targets."

## The Five Habits of a Craftsman

### 1: Decide What Capital Market you're In

Winner-take-all or auction. (One killer skill or diverse collection of skills)

Mistaking a winner-take-all for an auction market is common. _(Hollywood is winner-take-all. Don't get job at National Lampoon thinking you're building skills.)_

Blogging in the advice space is winner-take-all. The only capital that matters is whether or not your posts compel the reader.
_(stop calculating your bounce rate and start focusing instead on saying something people really care about)_

Auction: There are many different types of career capital, and each person might generate their own unique collection.

### 2: Identify Your Capital Type

Identify the specific type of capital to pursue.

In a winner-take-all market, this is trivial: By definition, there's only one type of capital

For an auction market, however, seek open gates: opportunities to build capital that are already open to you. Open gates get you farther faster.

Think about skill acquisition like a freight train: Getting it started requires a huge application of effort, but changing its track once it's moving is easy. In other words, it's hard to start from scratch in a new field.

### 3: Define "Good"

Clear goals.

For a script writer, the definition of "good" was clear: his scripts being taken seriously.

### 4: Stretch and Destroy

Deliberate practice: the uncomfortable sensation in my head is best approximated as a physical strain, as if my neurons are physically re-forming into new configurations.

### 5: Be Patient

Look years into the future for the payoff.

It's less about paying attention to your main pursuit, and more about your willingness to ignore other pursuits that pop up along the way to distract you.

Reject shiny new pursuits.

It's dangerous to pursue more control in your working life before you have career capital to offer in exchange.

Great missions are transformed into great successes as the result of using **small and achievable projects**—little bets—to explore the concrete possibilities surrounding a compelling idea.

**Once a week I require myself to summarize** in my “bible” a paper I think might be relevant to my research. This summary must include a description of the result, how it compares to previous work, and the main strategies used to obtain it.

…sheet has a row for each month on which I **keep a tally** of the total number of hours I’ve spent that month in a state of **deliberate practice**.

At the end of each of these brainstorming sessions I require myself to formally **record the results**, by hand, on a dated page.

“When deciding whether to follow an appealing pursuit that will introduce more control into your work life, ask yourself whether people are willing to pay you for it. If so, continue. If not, move on.”

…just how tricky it is to make this trait a reality in your working life. **The more you try to force it, I learned, the less likely you are to succeed**.

**First you need career capital**, which requires patience. Second, you need to be ceaselessly **scanning** your always-changing view of the **adjacent possible** in your field, looking for the next big idea. This requires a **dedication to brainstorming and exposure to new ideas**. Combined, these two commitments describe a lifestyle, not a series of steps that automatically spit out a mission when completed.

My system is guided, at the top level of the pyramid, by a tentative research mission—a sort of rough guideline for the type of work I’m interested in doing.

…bottom level, where we find my dedication to background research.

Every week, I expose myself to something new about my field.

To ensure that I really understand the new idea, I require myself to add a summary, in my own words, to my growing “research bible”

I use little bets to explore the most promising ideas turned up by the processes described by the bottom level of my pyramid. I try to keep **only two or three bets active** at a time so that they can receive intense attention. I also use deadlines, which I highlight in yellow in my planning documents, to help keep the urgency of their completion high. Finally, I also track my hours spent on these bets in the hour tally I described back in the section of this conclusion dedicated to my application of Rule #2. I found that without these **accountability tools**, I tended to procrastinate on this work, turning my attention to more urgent but less important matters.

Working right trumps finding the right work—it’s a simple idea, but it’s also incredibly subversive, as it overturns decades of folk career advice all focused on the mystical value of passion. It wrenches us away from our daydreams of an overnight transformation into instant job bliss and provides instead a more sober way toward fulfilment.
