Great missions are transformed into great successes as the result of using **small and achievable projects**—little bets—to explore the concrete possibilities surrounding a compelling idea.

**Once a week I require myself to summarize** in my “bible” a paper I think might be relevant to my research. This summary must include a description of the result, how it compares to previous work, and the main strategies used to obtain it.

…sheet has a row for each month on which I **keep a tally** of the total number of hours I’ve spent that month in a state of **deliberate practice**.

At the end of each of these brainstorming sessions I require myself to formally **record the results**, by hand, on a dated page.

“When deciding whether to follow an appealing pursuit that will introduce more control into your work life, ask yourself whether people are willing to pay you for it. If so, continue. If not, move on.”

…just how tricky it is to make this trait a reality in your working life. **The more you try to force it, I learned, the less likely you are to succeed**.

**First you need career capital**, which requires patience. Second, you need to be ceaselessly **scanning** your always-changing view of the **adjacent possible** in your field, looking for the next big idea. This requires a **dedication to brainstorming and exposure to new ideas**. Combined, these two commitments describe a lifestyle, not a series of steps that automatically spit out a mission when completed.

My system is guided, at the top level of the pyramid, by a tentative research mission—a sort of rough guideline for the type of work I’m interested in doing.

…bottom level, where we find my dedication to background research.

Every week, I expose myself to something new about my field.

To ensure that I really understand the new idea, I require myself to add a summary, in my own words, to my growing “research bible”

I use little bets to explore the most promising ideas turned up by the processes described by the bottom level of my pyramid. I try to keep **only two or three bets active** at a time so that they can receive intense attention. I also use deadlines, which I highlight in yellow in my planning documents, to help keep the urgency of their completion high. Finally, I also track my hours spent on these bets in the hour tally I described back in the section of this conclusion dedicated to my application of Rule #2. I found that without these **accountability tools**, I tended to procrastinate on this work, turning my attention to more urgent but less important matters.

Working right trumps finding the right work—it’s a simple idea, but it’s also incredibly subversive, as it overturns decades of folk career advice all focused on the mystical value of passion. It wrenches us away from our daydreams of an overnight transformation into instant job bliss and provides instead a more sober way toward fulfillment.
