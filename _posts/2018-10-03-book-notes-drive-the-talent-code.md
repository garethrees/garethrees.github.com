## Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us

![Book Cover of Drive](/images/posts/drive.jpg)

People are motivated by:

- **Autonomy**: the feeling that you have control over your day, and that your actions are important
- **Mastery**: the feeling that you are good at what you do
- **Purpose**: the feeling of connection to other people

## The Talent Code: Greatness isn’t born. It's grown.

Talent is created by a motivation “Ignition” and lots of “Deep Practice”.

### Ignition

- **Sparks:** Some chance event happens and motivates a group of people; e.g. Someone from your country or hometown makes it big.
- **Make your own:** A vision of a better situation compared to now that you see as a “spark”; e.g. Getting in to college.

### Deep Practice

Deep practice is forcing yourself to work **just outside the edge of your comfort zone**.

### Coaching

Master coaching is important to **identify and eliminate errors** in a fast feedback loop, which helps you level-up.
