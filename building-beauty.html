  <h1>Building Beauty 2020-2021</h1>

  <p>In 2020-2021 I participated in the <a href="https://www.buildingbeauty.org/building-beauty-online">Building Beauty Online course</a> and the <a href="https://www.buildingbeauty.org/beautiful-software">Beautiful Software seminar</a>.</p>

  <p>The course had four modules: <a href="#studio">Studio</a>, <a href="#appropriate-construction">Appropriate Construction</a>, <a href="#the-nature-of-order">The Nature of Order</a> and <a href="#beautiful-software">Beautiful Software</a>. This page acts as an index of my <a href="#all-posts">weeknotes</a> and a curated selection of links to some of the highlights.</p>

  <h2 id="studio">Studio</h2>

  <p>This was the core of the course and was hands-on from day one. We did four main Studio projects. Here are quick links to the final results of each:</p>

    <li><a href="/2020/11/30/building-beauty-week-7-8/#studio">Furniture</a> – A lamp for a corner</li>
    <li><a href="/2020/12/22/building-beauty-week-11/#studio">House</a> – A retreat for thinking</li>
    <li><a href="/2021/04/26/builing-beauty-week-25/#individual-project-presentation">Individual Project</a> – A home office with life</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="appropriate-construction">Appropriate Construction</h2>

  <p>The Appropriate Construction module brought in speakers who'd worked with or who's work was inspired by Alexander. It mostly focused on the use of materials. Here are the sessions where I published notes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="/2020/10/19/building-beauty-week-2/#appropriate-construction">Carpets</a></li>
    <li><a href="/2020/11/03/building-beauty-week-4/#appropriate-construction">Bamboo</a></li>
    <li><a href="/2020/11/17/building-beauty-week-6/#appropriate-construction">Straw Bale</a></li>
    <li><a href="/2020/12/13/building-beauty-week-10/#appropriate-construction">University Campus</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="the-nature-of-order">The Nature of Order</h2>

  <p>You can browse scans of my hand-written index-card <a href="/2021/06/09/book-notes-nature-of-order-book-1/">booknotes</a>, but <a href="http://nature-of-order.stefan-lesser.com/">Stefan's Nature of Order Digital Garden</a> is probably much more useful.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="/2020/10/25/building-beauty-week-3/#nature-of-order">The 15 fundamental properties</a> – comparing the life in two gardens</li>
    <li><a href="/2020/11/10/building-beauty-week-5/#nature-of-order">Mirror of the Self</a> – trying to understand this quite tricky concept</li>
    <li><a href="/2020/11/17/building-beauty-week-6/#nature-of-order">Unfolding</a> – building through unplanned step-by-step transformations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="beautiful-software">Beautiful Software</h2>

  <p>My notes for the Beautiful Software seminar are a bit sparse. It was really interesting to try to map Alexander's work to our experience of software, but there were loads of rabbit holes and since it was the first year, we lacked a bit of structure.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="/2020/11/10/building-beauty-week-5/#software">Where to start?</a> – some notes from discussions around how we even begin to figure out what beautiful software looks like</li>
    <li><a href="/2021/02/18/building-beauty-week-15-16/#nature-of-order">Scale</a> – different levels of scale require different structures, both in architecture and software</li>
    <li><a href="/2021/01/24/building-beauty-week-12-13/#nature-of-order">Topologise</a> – computer-generated building designs based on A Pattern Language</li>
    <li>An attempt at <a href="/2021/04/20/building-beauty-week-24/#beautiful-software">grouping our discussions</a> based on concepts referenced from Alexander's work</li>
  </ul>
