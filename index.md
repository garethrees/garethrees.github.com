I currently work at [mySociety](http://www.mysociety.org) building [Freedom of Information](https://www.mysociety.org/freedom-of-information/) tools installed in over [25 countries](http://alaveteli.org/deployments/).

In 2017 I was a member of the Welsh Assembly's [Digital News and Engagement Taskforce](http://www.assembly.wales/en/abthome/about_us-commission_assembly_administration/Pages/Digital-News-and-Information-Taskforce.aspx). The objective of the Taskforce was to explore and [recommend](http://www.assembly.wales/SiteCollectionDocuments/Taskforce-Report-web-E.pdf) the most effective ways to increase levels of public understanding and engagement with audiences currently disengaged with politics and Welsh affairs.

## Community

I founded and run [cardiffrb](http://cardiffrb.com), a monthly meet up for Ruby programmers in [Cardiff, UK](http://goo.gl/maps/5VuC8).

I created [Cardiff Collective](http://web.archive.org/web/20140212012139/http://collective.cardiffstart.com/) as a place for entrepreneurs in Cardiff to connect and share knowledge.

I worked with [Sam Knight](http://samknight.co.uk) to open Welsh politics with [Your Senedd](https://web.archive.org/web/20171020022609/http://yoursenedd.wales/).
